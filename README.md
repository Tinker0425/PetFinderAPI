## :question: Problem description

The **problem** is the challenge of handling, processing, and visualizing pet adoption data from
[Pet Finder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/) in an automated, 
scalable, and efficient manner. The **solution** is an end-to-end data pipeline leveraging 
**Python, Terraform, DBT, Google BigQuery, and Google Cloud Storage**, with workflow automation via **GitHub Actions**.
I volunteer with local pet rescues who use PetFinder daily and wanted to learn more about the data available. 
Here are some of my initial questions:

- :question: What are the top 5 orange cat names on PetFinder?
- :question: Is there a time of year when more adoptable pets are added to the site?
- :question: What additional species are on PetFinder besides cats & dogs?
- :question: What are the details of the adoptable dogs from Save Rocky the Great Dane Rescue?

---

## :building_construction: Pipeline Architecture

The architecture of the data pipeline involves several components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Extracting pet adoption data from the PetFinder API using Python. Automated with Github Actions daily batch cron job.
2. **Storage & Processing**: Using **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as a data lake** and **Python with Terraform** for automation.  
3. **Data Warehousing**: Moving processed data from GCS to **Google BigQuery** using Python.  
4. **Data Transformation**: Using **DBT** to clean, model, and optimize data by processing and transforming the data for meaningful insights using partitioning and clustering. 
5. **Visualization**: Creating a **Google Data Studio Looker dashboard** with 2 tiles of insights on pet adoption trends.  
6. **Automation**: Using **GitHub Actions** yml file for automated daily cron batch processing.

![project workflow](project.drawio.svg)

:warning: Note that the user must manually create an account for [PetFinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/), 
add Github Secrets, and create a Google Cloud account.

## :cloud: Cloud

This project utilizes Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services including Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Data Lake
and BigQuery Data Warehouse for data storage and processing. This project uses Terraform `Infrastructure as Code (IaC)` to automate 
the setup and management of cloud resources including the GCP bucket for the data lake.

---

## :violin: Batch / Workflow orchestration

This project uses Github Actions to run batches daily. The workflow orchestration pipeline is:

- Automatically ingesting daily data from the API into the cloud storage (data lake).
- Moving data from the data lake to BigQuery (data warehouse).
- Transforming data using dbt.
- Visualizing data in Looker.

---

### :question: What is Github Actions? 

In your GitHub Repo, you can find 'Actions' by looking for the tab with the forward arrow :arrow_forward:

In this project, GitHub Actions is used to automate daily batch jobs by setting up a workflow with a cron schedule that 
runs at a specific time each day. This is done using the on: schedule event in a workflow YAML file. 
Inside the workflow, jobs are defined with steps that execute scripts, run commands, or trigger external services.
This daily batch job fetches data from an API, process it, and stores the results in google cloud storage. 
The automation ensures that tasks run consistently without manual intervention.

---

## :file_cabinet: Data warehouse

This project uses BigQuery for the data warehouse and the tables are partitioned and clustered. For the petfinder
dataset, I partition by processed date, and then cluster by species, age group, and state.

---

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Transformations 

The **DBT** transformations take place in **BigQuery**, where raw data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
The transformation script is as follows:

```SQL

-- models/transformations/transformed_petfinder.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='table',
    partition_by={'field': 'published_at', 'data_type': 'TIMESTAMP'},
    cluster_by=['species', 'age_group', 'state']
) }}

WITH cleaned_data AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        name,
        species,
        age,
        gender,
        size,
        primary_breed,
        primary_color,
        CAST(spayed_neutered AS BOOL) AS spayed_neutered,
        CAST(house_trained AS BOOL) AS house_trained,
        CAST(declawed AS BOOL) AS declawed,
        CAST(special_needs AS BOOL) AS special_needs,
        CAST(shots_current AS BOOL) AS shots_current,
        CAST(good_with_children AS BOOL) AS good_with_children,
        CAST(good_with_dogs AS BOOL) AS good_with_dogs,
        CAST(good_with_cats AS BOOL) AS good_with_cats,
        tags,
        location,
        SPLIT(location, ', ')[SAFE_OFFSET(0)] AS city,
        SPLIT(location, ', ')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)] AS state,
        postcode,
        published_at,
        organization_id,
        email,
        CASE
            WHEN ARRAY_LENGTH(SPLIT(tags, ', ')) > 0 THEN ARRAY_TO_STRING(SPLIT(tags, ', '), ', ')
            ELSE NULL
        END AS tags_string,
        CASE
            WHEN age = 'Baby' THEN '0-1 years'
            WHEN age = 'Young' THEN '1-3 years'
            WHEN age = 'Adult' THEN '3-7 years'
            WHEN age = 'Senior' THEN '7+ years'
            ELSE 'Unknown'
        END AS age_group
    FROM {{ ref('stg_petfinder') }}
)

SELECT * FROM cleaned_data

```


## :rocket: Dashboard Visualization

**Google Data Studio - Looker** to create and share the dashboard.

After loading the transformed data into BigQuery, a dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends in pet adoption:
- **Tile 1**: A pie chart showing the distribution of species (ex. dog, cat, rabbit, etc).
- **Tile 2**: A time series chart showing the total number of pet profiles added daily to PetFinder.
